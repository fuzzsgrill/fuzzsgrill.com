There is a band out there and they are really small. I am sure that you have not heard of them, Twenty One Pilots. They are a band that is based out of Columbus, Ohio, and they make alternative Rock, electropop, alternative hip hop, rap rock, indie pop, and pop rock. All of their stuff is amazing. Tyler Joseph the lead singer of the band sounds amazing, he can rap fast and still be clear to everyone that is listening (unlike all other rappers). Josh Dun the bands drummer is loud (according to Joseph, and Jim his dog), and is impressive. He is always doing bits like in the Clancy live stream every single time the camera goes to the duo talking about the new album he is eating something. He even baked cookies in the middle of the night. In the music video for "Saturday" he starts to fix the submarine when Joseph is on the phone. Eventually he screams as part of the song and its great. The mix is nice and is not overwhelming while listening to the song. 

The band makes music on the most random topics, things from depression, love songs ("The Craving"). There is a song that talks about the stress of being an adult. It is something that we unfortunately have to do, and trust me when I say that I still want to be a child instead of an adult ("Stressed Out"). This band has a wide range of music and I am constantly listening to them when ever I can.

The also have stories to tell, right now they are doing a lore based story. The story goes that in a city called Dema, in the continent of Trench there is a man named Clancy who is trying to escape the city. In the city there are nine bishops that rule the city. They practice the religion Vialism which teaches self destruction is the way to paradise.

Clancy is there to fight Nico the leader of the nine bishops, who keeps catching him and bringing him back to Dema. Clancy also learns how to control bodies though the Ned's (creatures that live in Trench. Their antlers allow those who have them to control bodies) antlers. 

The story is something interested in and I can't wait for more to come out, however they are on tour right now so it will be a while before we get the next part of the story. Clancy fights Nico in "Paladin Straight" but I am not sure what happens after that. 

As punishment for his actions and attempting to escape the city, the bishops make Clancy preform as seen in "Saturday" on the *Scaled and Icy* album. I was talking to a friend about this (who is a fan of Twenty on Pilots) and he said when I asked him about the lore of the band:

>  Would you allow to escape anyone who is a threat to your ideology. Rather than try to keep them and make an example of them. That’s exactly what Nico did — the bishops made an example of Clancy and forced him to perform for the city

There is something outside of Dema, something that the government is not wanting to be exposed. There are the Banditos the group who lives outside of Trench. One of them is Josh Dun who leads Clancy away from Dema. 

Aside from having all this lore they love to have fun. "Lavish" is a great example of this. They created something that I have not seen before. A lyric/music video. They drove around town and... you should see it for yourself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flYgpeWsC2E 

The duo is the real life version of Phineas and Ferb, it's great. One place that you may know the band is the Grammys, when they took their pants off. During the Vessel 10th anniversary live stream Joseph said:

>Some people have asked me for the Grammys you know when we took our pants off we are in our underwear. People asked me "Hey how did you know that Josh was going to follow you? What if he just made you, cause I took my pants of first as I was first in line. What if he let you walk up there by yourself?" And watching this, when we make stuff up you were always there to make sure that I didn't feel stupid. 

Dun laughed and said "I will commit with you". Find someone who will commit to the bit with you. The fact that these two do a lot together and make the most random things up is funny and amusing. Most of their YouTube shorts are just them being strange, and silly. One time a soap dispenser broke  while they were trying to do something else. Dun stopped to fix it before going on with Joseph. 


I have done two  ETC EOS designs from them and I am super happy on how it came out. Overcompensate from Clancy.
