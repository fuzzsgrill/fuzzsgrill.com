There is a show out there and it was a comfort show to me and it still does comfort me at the hardest times, or when I need to watch something and there is nothing else on. I grew up with this show and loved it. I always looked forward to seeing the show and would enjoy seeing it when I came home from school and looked forward to it. 

Phineas and Ferb (the boys) are about two brothers who create something new every day. Their older sister Candace is there to attempt to stop them from doing what they are doing. They could be building a roller coaster, a shrinking submarine, or a time machine. Candace is trying to get them busted but fails because their inventions disappear every time. 


They also have a pet platypus named Perry and I love him in my opinion he is the best character in the entire show. He has his personality, is smart, knows how to escape traps, and cares about his family. He battles Doctor Doofenshmirtz who is attempting to take over the tristate area, but the self-destruct buttons that he puts on his inventions are the reason for him not taking over the tristate area, Perry defeats him every time. The two are nemeses they fight but are also friends and support each other.  

One thing that I love about the show is that Doof is the best cartoon dad out there. He cares about his daughter Vanessa, and always puts her first. He loves her and it shows, that he does things from embarrassing her to supporting her in her activities (like swimming he stopped on the other team's feet, clapping loudly at her recital). Even though he is "evil" he has a big heart. 

All of the characters are related in some way, Phineas and Ferb are stepbrothers, and Phineas and Candace are biological siblings. Perry fights Doof daily and is not afraid to do it again. There are a few episodes where it is only Perry and Doof, however the other characters make an appearance.

Every day friends of the boys come over and help. Baljeet the nerd, solves all the math problems that come up and helps build. Bufford the bully is a friend/enemy of Baljeet, but they care about each other. Isabella, who is in love with Phineas (though he can't see that she is in love with him, says something in "Act Your Age"). 

This show is a part of me growing up and it will forever be a part of me. I love to watch the show after a long day or I just need something to do. Each episode has a song that is catchy amazing and works for the episode. The creators Dan Povenmire and Jeff "Swampy" Marsh have made the show as silly as they can and as colorful as possible like all kid's shows. They even voice-act some of the characters. Povermire voices Doof, and some of the other characters. Marsh voices Major Monogram who runs OWCA (Organization Without a Cool Acronym), and is the boss of Perry the Platypus. Everything blends and creates a seamless show. 




They created only four seasons but they are working on new seasons. 

All four seasons are available on Disney+.
