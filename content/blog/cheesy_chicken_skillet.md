The other day I was looking online for a recipe for dinner. I was planning on Sous Videing some chicken but I was not sure what to do with it. I came across this recipe and I wanted to share it with you. It is a cheesy, chicken, potato one skillet meal that according to my mom "It seems super basic and yet a comfort food". With out a further ado let's get into it: 

## What you'll need: 
1. A skillet 
2. A bowel
3. A cutting board 
4. A knife
5. 4 Chicken breasts (shredded or cubed)
6. 4 large Potatoes 
7. 2 tbs flour 
8. 2 tablespoons butter 
9. 1/2 cup chicken broth
10. 1/2 cup milk
11. 1/2 cup cheddar-shredded or grated
12. 1/2 cup parmesan-shredded or grated
13. Oil of your choice
14. Salt and pepper

## Recipe
1. Peel, wash and cube your potatoes in a bowel toss them with oil and salt and pepper.
2. Fry them in a pan until they are soft like French fries. Roughly 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Set the bowel aside for chicken. 
3. As the potatoes are going chop (or shred) the chicken
	1. Side note: I Sous Vide the chicken before hand to cut down some time on cooking. 90 minutes in water warmed to 150 degrees Fahrenheit or 65 degree Celsius. 
4. In the same bowel oil the chicken and season with salt and pepper.
5. Once the potatoes are done, carefully remove them and put the chicken in the same pan. Cook until it reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit or 73 degree Celsius. 
6. Once the chicken is done remove it from the pan. 
7. Add butter and coat the entire pan with it
8. Once the butter is melted add flour to the pan. This is called Roux. This stuff is to thicken sauces, stews, and soups. 
9. It will start to clump up together, when it does add your chicken broth. If you don't have chicken broth you can use chicken bullion. 
	1. 1 1/2 cup water
	2. 3 teaspoons bullion
	3. Boil water then mix in bullion. Bring to boil
10. Add milk and stir until it is thick
11. Once it is thick add 1/2 cup of cheddar and parmesan. Shredded or grated
12. Add the chicken and potatoes back in and simmer for 5 minutes
Enjoy. 

This is an amazing quick and easy meal. Be sure to follow food safety. Wash hands, and all surfaces that food may have came into contact with.
