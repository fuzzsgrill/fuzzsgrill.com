With a new season coming upon us I want to take a second and talk about the weather shift that is going to happen. 
If you live in the northern hemisphere on the planet earth (sorry flat earthers, you might want to skip this post) then you will know that it is spring time or soon to be depending on where you live. 
I love the spring time, the leaves start to come back and are pretty as they grow again. Flowers bud on the trees, the smell of the warm air is coming in. Along with (most importantly in my opinion) it is warming up (I am writing this in the afternoon and it is 27 degrees Celsius out there). It is truly a pretty day to sit inside and talk to about things that I feel are important (yes, guinea pigs, lions, and ETC are important). Here are some of the things that I feel are important about the spring time and feel that everyone should enjoy:
* It is warm, I was born in the summer so I feel that I just have a connection to the warmth. I am like a lizard who loves to sit on a rock and stay warm. 
* The rain: The rain is a pretty thing to see and feel on your skin. As Natasha Bedingfield says in her 2004 song Unwritten states 
> Feel the rain on your skin No one else can feel it for you
 
 It is true, no one can feel the rain on your skin. It is nice to stand out there and get wet from the cool rain. I love it. 
* The pictures that you can take: I took this picture using a macro lens. It's grass, I also took some bubble pictures. Yes, a picture of a bubble.

* It's just really nice out there. I love this weather, it's just really pretty out there. Don't believe me? This is a picture of flowers that grow in the spring. I am in love with the color scheme that is in place. You have yellows, blues, reds, oranges, and white. Along with a river. 
* It is time for Easter. I love doing a good easter egg hunt, finding the eggs all around the place. One year my Mom and Dad set up a non traditional easter egg hunt. It was a scavenger hunt but instead of looking for eggs. We looked for clues to find the easter baskets. We went all around the house. 
	* On a second Easter note I love the food that we make. Deviled eggs, ham, potatoes, rolls, and cake. I am getting hungry just thinking about it now. 

There are a few things that I do not like about the spring on the other hand. As I feel like I've said in several posts, there has to be bad things to counter balance out the good, its a balance. A teeter totter if you will. 

* The pollen, I do not look forward to the pollen coming back and making everything yellow. I remember getting ready to leave or go somewhere. I activated the windshield wipers and massive build up of the pollen came flying off the windshield. I also remember washing the car and the driveway had this pile of yellow at the end of it.
* The craziness of the year. Now is the time to switch out of winter stuff and get into your spring stuff. I don't have spring things. What I wear in the winter is the same year round (I do have more clothes but I don't change my closet around. Sometimes I want to wear a sweat shirt outside and I just keep it in my closet.)

That is about it. I do love this time of year, not to hot or not to cold. It is nice time to sit back with a root beer (A&W) and let time pass as the breeze rolls by.

So go and sit out there and just chill for a bit. Take your laptop if you want, or a book and enjoy.
