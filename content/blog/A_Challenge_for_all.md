I have a challenge for everyone, and I want you all to complete it. It is not a hard one but there it is: I want you to watch this short and then come back to this post:
https://www.youtube.com/shorts/5PCTkVTitPs

That was from YouTuber DannoDraws an amazing silly YouTuber that makes shorts on silly things to some of the most important things out there like mental health (he released a short about your doing your best and it hit me hard for some reason, a friendly reminder that we all need from time to time https://www.youtube.com/shorts/kkFIklTOXCY ). This short came to me this morning and I had to talk about it. 

This short proposes a challenge to all who come across it and I want to share it with you, the challenge is that you write a letter to your future self with your hopes and dreams and words of encouragement for your future self for things that didn't go right. I thought this would be a good and fun thing to do, so here we go. It does not have to be long; it just needs to be the right length for you. When you are done writing it there are a few more things to do. Here is mine below: 

Dear Fuzz, 
I know that you are scared for 2025, I understand that, and I am too. There are a lot of changes going on, you are advancing in school and are afraid that something is going to go wrong, and it will put your hopes and dreams to a grinding halt. I understand that fear, it is something that I live with too, but I want you to know that there are people all around you who are there for you. They are there to make sure that you succeed and are there to help you get up when you fall. Your family and friends are there, they are there for silliness, heart break, and when you need them the most: Loss. You are not alone on this journey, and I know it can seem that it is easy to feel that way but remember they are there for you.

Before I leave you to take over your hopes and dreams, I want to give you these things that I know you wanted to complete in 2025:

1. Relearn a skill, that piano that sits in the living room is wanting you to play it again

2. (Re)learn a language, such as Spanish, or Swahili (the language of the savanna that you have been saying phases from)

3. Keep this blog up, at the time of writing you are not sure how many readers are out there...but it is a lot of fun to write this and that is what matters (plus you feel like a hacker running command lines in the terminal) 

4. You want to grow in the language of computing: Linux, Minecraft servers, Windows and MacOS, and have a world of exploration that needs to be conquered

5. You want to be a good person and continue that growth. An old teacher said every time you exit her classroom "Be Wise, be Kind, and know that I always believe in you."

I know that you can do this, have confidence in yourself,
Fuzz

I know that might have been a bit heavy, but I know that it can help me in the future. Here are the last few steps to do before the end of the post.
Print, save, bookmark, do something that forces you to look back at this in a few months. A calendar notification works well for me. Do not be afraid to look at this as you need to, it is here to encourage you, not force you to reach your goals.

Spread this challenge to others around you. This time of year, can be stressful, especially after the holidays. 

I hope that this letter can help you and those around you into a good 2025. I promise that the next post will be lighter than the past two. 

Happy new year again,

Fuzz
