Sooooo I thought I should acknowledge this. Nintendo (who has been a big name my entire life. I grew up with the GameCube and the Wii, my brother and I would play all types of games on them, as we grew up then we drifted apart from the consoles. I went on and got the Nintendo Switch which was a concept that I had never heard of and thought that it was a break through in hand held gaming, only I didn't realize that there was the PlayStation PSP, and the Nintendo DS had a similar concept... heh. Oh hi Steam Deck, yes I see you. A Linux based computer that can play Steam. Talk about Linux gamers.) Anyway.... 

The Nintendo Switch 2 was released today and I saw the trailer so lets break it down shall we?
Here is the link to the trailer from Nintendo's official YouTube:

Ok so the first thing that we see is the original switch and its iconic Joy cons sliding off the console. A basic idea and I love it, there is a feeling of power grabbing them off the dock and the console. The console then doubles in size and rounds itself a nice touch to the old boxy system. It goes though transformations and is that a USB-C port on its top?

That is an interesting thing to see... While we are up here look to the right of the USB-C port... It's our old friend the headphone jack a feature that I miss. It can also go into a nicer Tabletop mode that  I wish was on the old console. There have been times when I want to lean back and have the console in a lower position and I can't do that as the stand won't allow it. Very nice touch Nintendo.


Next the video moves onto the Joy cons and their iconic blue and red (a neat touch but I am a darker color person myself. My computer, phone, is all in dark mode, and I prefer the darker colors over the brighter ones). They double in size and there is now a new button on the right Joy Con under the home button. They then added blue and red accents to the controllers and I think that is a really nice touch to the overall look of the console.

Here is the part that I am the most excited for!! They are magnetic! So now they clip onto the console and not slide on or off. That is a really cool feature and has to be super satisfying to dock and pull them apart.

They showcased the dock and I don't see any massive differences aside from the it having a rounded look to it.

The entire thing is still using USB-C to charge and hook up to the TV, allowing for seamless connectivity. The adapters are also magnetic following the consoles pattern. In my opinion aesthetic wise it look amazing and I can't wait to see one in person. For what it has inside I don't have that info but I can tell you that it has backwards compatibility on it. So all your Switch 1 games are playable on Switch 2. 

A lot of the other details (games, software, and hardware) I am not going to discuss until there is more info. It does look like Nintendo has demos set up all round the world so you can see it for yourself. I am excited for this console to come out (April 2025). The Switch was a massive success and this one takes it up a notch.
