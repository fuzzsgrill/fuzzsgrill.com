Back on February 17th 2025 I published a post titled Phineas and Ferb.
(If you have not read it yet, go back and read it :https://fuzzsgrill.com/blog/phineas_and_ferb/ )

In that post I said: `They created only four seasons but they are working on new seasons.` Well, they did it! They created more seasons. They have season 5 released on Disney+ right now. I have watched the entire thing and I am going back and watching select episodes. These are my thoughts on it: 
* I LOVE it. Phineas and Ferb is a show that is always close to me and I will always love it and enjoy it. 
* Perry is more animated, they gave him a bigger personality and I love him. He shows more expressions, "talks" more, and they continued some lore that they left untouched with him (Stacy knows about him being a secret agent)
* It is the original cast, they brought them back*. I was not ready for Jeremy (Candance's boyfriend) to have a deep voice. Characters like Phineas Flynn (voiced by Vincent Martella) had a deeper voice as the show was going on back in 2007-2015, same with Buford Van Stomm (Bobby Gaylor) and Ferb Fletcher although it was rare to hear Ferb talk. 
* They have new adventures, songs and jokes
Candance is up to her own antics with trying to bust her brothers, but fails when the boy's inventions disappear thanks to Doof and Perry. Speaking of Doof and Perry they are back to their old ways. Doof creating inators to take over the tri-state area and Perry comes in and puts it to a stop. It is routine that this happens daily. I found this while I was getting some info "Heinz has become so used to this foiling that he usually feels empty or upset on the few occasions where Perry does not stand in his way." That is in the official wiki for the show. It is true, if Perry is not there to stop him then he is upset, its routine. 


I am super happy that they have brought this show back after its finale in 2015. They have been renewed for 2 seasons consisting of 20 episodes each. I am ready for it all. 

The way that they picked up the after going off air for 10 years was that they kids where in school. Doof was a high school teacher, and Perry was fighting a giant robotic scorpion. All for 9 months. It does seem a bit strange when you think about it, however time in cartoons is a strange concept to understand. You are never sure how old the characters in the TV show are. There are attempts to guess on how old the characters are. Most guesses do try to get it right for example: Phineas and Ferb are 7-10 years old (I'm guessing 10), Perry is around 5. They did announce some ages, like Doofs (47) and Candance (16). 

This show is wonderful and I am thrilled that it is back. I am hoping that they continue to make it for a while as it is a popular show, with games, books, and more based off it. 


This is what I meant when I said "*". Select voice actors (VA) are no longer around. Jeremy's VA was supposedly fired, and Ferbs VA was replaced due to scheduling conflicts. This is a super common thing. If a new show needs an actor that is in a different show, they will replace the actor in the original show or in the case of Ashley Tisdale from Suite Life of Zack and Cody, who played Sharpay Evans in *High School Musical* they will write the character off. They go out on an adventure, they go and do something else that is the cause of them not coming back to the show.
