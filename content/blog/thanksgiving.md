I want to ask you a question... What does Thanksgiving mean to you?
Is it a time for thankfulness? A time to sit around the fire and watch the flames flicker while family sits with you and all drink hot coco? 
Or is it time to sit back and wait for Christmas to come around? 

To me it means a time for cool weather, and a time for Christmas to come around. It also signals that chaos is about to happen. Your family is going to be coming to town to spend the holiday with you. It is nice to be able to sit around the table or in the living room and talk the night away.
One of my favorite traditions that comes with Thanksgiving is all the food that can be made. I am not sure why, but it is rare for us to make Green Bean Casserole though out the year. I know its tradition and it should be reserved for Thanksgiving and Christmas but there have been times where it would be nice to have it and maybe a turkey sandwich with it. 

I know I know; I just described a stripped-down Thanksgiving dinner, but think about it, is there a reason why we can't have some of the Thanksgiving foods at any point in the year? I don't see why not (again tradition, but it is tradition to change those traditions). 

One thing that my family used to do is put up inflatable turkeys around the yard doing some type of shenanigan. It was fun to go out and reposition these birds, so they were trying to escape to Canada and then fail and somehow land on the roof. It was nice to see their antics change every week. Then every Thanksgiving Day we would make them do one last bit. Like put them in our Trailblazer as they were going to drive to Canada, but they didn't have route planned. 

As I sit here writing this post for you a thought came into my head: Is Thanksgiving the time when you can see if the holiday chaos is still alive and well as we are used to? Is it a time to make sure that you can take the chaos that happens? 
I guess there are several ways to find the answer, letâ€™s start with what your Thanksgiving traditions are. Are you traditional where you serve a turkey with all the sides (rolls, mashed potatoes, stuffing, cranberry sauce (where when you smack it with a spoon it jiggles like Jello and brings a smile to all))? Or do you do it your own way? My family has been known to make things different than what tradition states, in the past few years to keep stress down we would cater though a company like Honey Baked Ham Co. It makes it easy though there is a struggle with timing and how we are going to time it, so everything comes out hot. There is also the idea of dessert, what to make for it? That is the one question that I face these seasons. What to do for the last course? I love to bake and there are a lot of items out there. Do I make something new, something I'm used to or something that works and will work for all?

There is one new tradition that I am hoping stays, my friends and I hop into a Discord call and watch A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving provided by Apple TV. 

It is nice that Apple has found that there is a tradition of curling up to be nice and warm and allowing anyone to watch this classic. While I have never watched Charlie Brown on a regular basis as a kid, these shows have hit close to home for some reason. I think these were watched in school and that is why I love them so much. 

Each holiday season school would tailor itself to teach students about the holiday that was around the corner (aside from the religious holidays, although we would say "Merry Christmas" or "Happy Easter" to each other, we were in elementary school). That didn't stop the teachers from cueing up these iconic shows and shows us Charlie Brown, while the teacher was in the corner grading away or watching the show. 

Thanksgiving can mean a lot to us all. With the conclusion of this post coming soon, I want to wish everyone a Happy Thanksgiving and spend it in your traditional way. Everyone has their traditions and honors these holidays in certain ways. 

Happy Thanksgiving everyone,
